Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. He just turned 17 a week ago and was practicing for his road test to get a driver's licence. He practiced driving with his dad everyday. He drove everywhere
around the city. Then he learned to drive in the highway. When the day of his road test came, he got very nervous. Fortunatly, he was able to pass the test and drive by him self from now.
An almost utopian world formed around him as he drove. For the next 30 years of his life, he was
somehow able to not get into any accidents, or get any tickets from law enforcement. However, on the
fateful day of February 30th, 2050, things started to change for the worse. Through all his years
driving, he'd only heard fables about a legendary shiny lamp. This lamp, the legends told, was able
to give you endless good fortune, and even has the power to grant you one wish. As stories went, the
year 2050 is the year of the start of Lampenschrein, a sinful apocalypse about to unfold.

It was February 31st. The Lampenschrein has just started. A serious event indeed, and yet our hero
is sitting at a computer, doing his CS400 Git assignment, trying to figure out how to push his own
changes to his X-Team's repository. Oh, how many seconds he's spent toiling away at such an unforgiving task! 

Then later that day after finishing his Git assignment, Tim had been cleaning out his attic and was looking through
his great grandfather's old stuff when he discovered something mysterious. He found a big shiny lamp. But this lamp
wasn't just any lamp, it was the SHINIEST lamp he had ever seen. When he tried rubbing it to wipe the dust off. A
genie appeared from the lamp informing him that he had one and only one wish.

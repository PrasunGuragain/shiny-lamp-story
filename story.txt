Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. He just turned 17 a week ago and was practicing for his road test to get a driver's licence. He practiced driving with his dad everyday. He drove everywhere
around the city. Then he learned to drive in the highway. When the day of his road test came, he got very nervous. Fortunatly, he was able to pass the test and drive by him self from now.
